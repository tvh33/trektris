::Moving stars in background:
	Idle while on impulse power
	Moving once warp speed.
	Speed and streaks increasing in intervals as warp grows


::Levels:
Impulse power:
	[0,1,2,3]
Warp speed:
	[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,9.5,9.7,9.9,9.9999999999999]
	last level: nearing warp asymptote

::Scoring system:
	Combo (message from Troi/Geordi):
		rows cleared more than three times in a row
	2 tetris in a row
	3 tetris in a row
	x rows in less than 20 seconds
	
	

::Ship systems:
Powering different systems:
	Shields/weapon: balancing power
	Warp: separate power
	
	Power:
		Power decreases by some variable changing every level
		Ability to change strategy (offensive/defensive):
			transfer power from weapons to shields (message from Data)
			transfer power from shields to weapons (message from worf)
		Warp core is loaded when rows are cleared
		
		Tetris adds additional power to shield/weapon bank
		
Shield system:
	Value: 0-100%
	Stages: up/holding (messages from Data)
			down/failing/disrupted/penetrated (messages from Data)
			Consequences:
				Probability: 10-50
				Able to take hits: random holes in board (messages from Data)
				Weird shaped tetrominos	
			Time to normal: 
				40 sec (-8 sec for each row during downtime)
				

Weapon system:
	Value: 0-100%
	Phasers
		Clear rows from bottom
	Photon torpedoes
		Blow top rows to parts
		

Warp system:
	Value: 0-100%
	When nearing threshold:
		> 90% (messages from Geordi - telling how many rows needed)
	Threshold reached:
		>= 100% (message from Geordi)
		next 'level', increase (warp)speed.
